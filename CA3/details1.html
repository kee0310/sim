                <h1>What is Grab?</h1>
                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grab_(company)">Grab Holdings Inc.</a>, commonly known as Grab, is a 
                    Singaporean multinational company headquartered in Singapore. In addition to transportation, the company offers 
                    food delivery and digital payments services via a mobile app. Starting in 2012 as the MyTeksi app based in Kuala 
                    Lumpur, Malaysia, it expanded the next year as GrabTaxi. It has since expanded into other services, following the 
                    "super app" model. In 2014, it moved its headquarters to Singapore and renamed itself to just Grab.It currently 
                    mostly operates in Southeast Asia. It is the region's first "decacorn" (a startup with a valuation of over US$10 billion), 
                    and as of May 2021 its valuation was just under US$40 billion.</p>
