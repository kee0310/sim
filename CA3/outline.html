                        <h1>IBM: Redesigning skillsets for the future economy</h1>
                        <p>In today’s workplace, emerging technologies like AI and IoT are transforming business processes and customer experiences. Global tech company IBM’s ‘Future-Ready Intelligent Digital Workforce Programme’, 
                            in partnership with IMDA, seeks to hire and train Singaporean professionals in these fields to meet the demand for deep digital and technical expertise across a myriad of industries.
                            300 professionals, from fresh graduates to mid-career professionals, will train for in-demand roles like Digital Consultants and Cloud Architects. The programme welcomes a diversity of talents, who will 
                            not only hone their skills through immersive exposure to technologies like advanced analytics and blockchain, but also apply these skills to real-world scenarios for smarter work outcomes.<br><br>

                        <p>Whether it’s discovering new worlds through augmented reality, or strengthening human-machine partnerships with Internet of Things (IoT) and autonomous vehicles, a hyperconnected digital future 
                            may become a reality sooner than we think. Singtel is working hard to make this happen, by building Singapore’s 5G ecosystem and training its workforce to pivot with this transformation.
                            Under Singtel’s recently inked partnership with IMDA, the National University of Singapore (NUS), and Singapore Polytechnic (SP), Singtel will hire over 500 people in the next two years, 
                            blending 5G-related academic programmes with on-the-job training. With a mission to deploy breakthrough technologies at scale, these programmes are dedicated to nurturing a future-ready workforce.
